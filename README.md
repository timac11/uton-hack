2.Send the link to our application
3.Timestamps each response in a blinded way on the Hedera Hashgraph blockchain platform with a goal to guarantee that all votes will be taken into account

# How it works?

1.Sign up for APP& Creating a form.Confirm your information. Construct form for your poll using a wide range of Google Form instruments.
2.Submission parameters & Payment.Leave a link to Google survey form, wait for validation of questions on the Hedera Hashgraph and pay for the service using Hashing Systems instruments.
3.Research flow.You can share a link to a Google form with survey participants. Our service automatically hashes each answer and store it in an orderly manner on the hashgraph.
4.Get reviewers on your research.Send the results of the responses to several reviewers and confirm that research results match the stored proofs.
5.Proof of non-selective reporting.In your application’s dashboard, share evidence of non-selective reporting with anyone, which consists of survey statistics, a link to saved proof, and a list of reviewers who checked compliance

# Why it is the best way to guarantee non-selective reporting?

-Using blockchain to hash data and guarantee the immutability of information
-Integration with Google Forms, without additional actions on the part of the survey participant
-An easy way to guarantee non-selective reporting by providing a link to our website and checking with thу blockchain
-A mechanism for finding independent reviewers to ensure the completeness and correctness of the stored data



# Why Hedera Hashgraph Blockchain?

1.Less cost of transactions. 
Hedera: cost in one transaction~ 0,0001 $. Ethereum: cost in one transaction ~ 0,1$. 
Hedera:  for reporting of  1000 participants <1$. Ethereum:  for reporting of  1000 participants -100 $. 
2.Orderly transactions in the blockchain

The product allows you to guarantee a big audience that your social polls or review are not selective reporting.

During this hackathon:

- We have created a fully working web application to guarantee a big audience that your social polls or review are not selective reporting.
- Use the Hedera Hashgraph Blockchain and Hashing System for fast and low-cost storage of the hash of information.
- Our prototype are fully working and easy to use

We want faster progress in scientific research and. avoid the problem of selective reporting!

# Team

We implemented all this within the application on the hackathon UTON Hack 2.0 with the active interaction of the whole team!
